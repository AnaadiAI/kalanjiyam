<p>{% trans %}
When we first started planning this project, we knew we wanted to build a platform to
transcribe and preserve Siddha texts. Since the platform would store texts in a digital
format and make them accessible to everyone, we wanted a name that reflected this
purpose.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
After much consideration, we chose to name
the project "Kalanjiyam," which means "treasure of knowledge" or "repository of wisdom"
in Tamil. This name perfectly captures our mission to preserve and share the vast
knowledge contained in Siddha texts.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
As a Tamil word, it is simple and meaningful to the ear. It represents the ancient
wisdom and knowledge systems that we are working to preserve and make accessible.
The word "Kalanjiyam" itself embodies the concept of a comprehensive collection
of knowledge, which is exactly what we aim to create.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
The name also reflects our commitment to preserving the cultural and linguistic
heritage of the Siddha tradition, which has its roots in Tamil Nadu and has
contributed significantly to the fields of medicine, alchemy, and spiritual knowledge.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
We believe that this name honors the tradition we serve while also being
accessible and memorable to our global community of users and contributors.
