<h1>{{ _('Mission') }}</h1>

<p>{% trans %}
Kalanjiyam's mission is to preserve and make accessible the ancient Siddha Knowledge Systems tradition 
through collaborative digital preservation. Specifically, we have three goals:
{% endtrans %}</p>

<ol>
<li>{% trans %}
Create <strong>a comprehensive digital archive</strong> of traditional Siddha literature through collaborative proofing
{% endtrans %}</li>

<li>{% trans %}
Preserve this archive in <strong>an open, accessible format</strong> for future generations.
{% endtrans %}</li>

<li>{% trans %}
Provide <strong>collaborative tools</strong> for researchers, practitioners, and community members to contribute to preservation efforts.
{% endtrans %}</li>
</ol>


<h2>{{ _('A complete archive') }}</h2>

<p>{% trans %}
The Siddha corpus is vast. Conservative estimates suggest that there are thousands
of surviving Siddha manuscripts and texts covering medicine, alchemy, yoga, and
spiritual knowledge. While many of these manuscripts are near-duplicates of each
other, they still represent a literature that is rich and overflowing with ancient wisdom.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
Of these manuscripts, only a few are available as published books. Of these
books, only a few are available as digital scans. Of these scans, only a few
are available as machine-readable text files. And of these files, only a few
are reliable and error-free.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
There are several online Siddha archives that have made sincere efforts to
preserve and display some of this vast literature. We are deeply grateful to
our predecessors and their work. But sadly, creating a complete archive is
a massive and multidisciplinary project, and it requires resources that most
projects lack.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
We believe that our collective engineering skill can drastically cut the cost
of publishing these texts. By doing so, we hope to succeed at this massive task
and build an archive that is as complete as possible.
{% endtrans %}</p>


<h2>{{ _('An open format') }}</h2>

<p>{% trans %}
A complete archive is of no use if it is difficult to access. We must publish
this archive as openly as we can and remove the tedious barriers that impede
access to Siddha literature.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
More concretely, we publish our texts on a free and public website under
permissive licensing. We ensure that our texts are delightfully readable on a
variety of devices. We share our work freely so that users can take what we
produce and use it for their own needs, whatever they might be.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
Soon, our website will be available in multiple languages. That way, every
reader can access and enjoy our collection in their native language.
{% endtrans %}</p>


<h2>{{ _('Collaborative preservation tools') }}</h2>

<p>{% trans %}
Our proofing platform provides the tools needed for community-driven preservation 
of Siddha texts, making the archive more accessible and accurate for all.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
For volunteers and contributors, our proofing interface makes it easy to 
transcribe and verify Siddha texts from manuscripts and printed sources. 
The collaborative nature ensures accuracy and community involvement in preservation efforts.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
For researchers and practitioners, our platform provides access to preserved 
texts with version control and revision history. This ensures that the 
authenticity and integrity of traditional knowledge is maintained while 
making it digitally accessible.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
For the broader community, our open platform allows anyone to contribute to 
the preservation of Siddha wisdom, whether through proofing texts, providing 
translations, or sharing knowledge about traditional practices.
{% endtrans %}</p>
