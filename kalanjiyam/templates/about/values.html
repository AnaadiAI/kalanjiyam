<p>{% trans %}
Kalanjiyam's mission is to make the Siddha Knowledge Systems tradition radically accessible. This
mission is guided by several core values that shape everything we do.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<h2>{{ _('Siddha Knowledge as human heritage') }}</h2>

<p>{% trans %}
Siddha Knowledge Systems literature is part of our collective human heritage, and we want to
preserve and share this knowledge for future generations. The Siddha tradition encompasses
not just medicine and alchemy, but also philosophy, spirituality, and practical wisdom
that has been passed down through centuries.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
We believe that this knowledge belongs to all of humanity and should be freely accessible
to anyone who wishes to learn from it, regardless of their background, location, or
economic status.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<h2>{{ _('Radical accessibility') }}</h2>

<p>{% trans %}
We believe that knowledge should be accessible to everyone. This means not just making
texts available online, but also providing tools and resources that make the content
understandable and useful to people at all levels of expertise.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
Our platform includes features like word-by-word analysis, integrated dictionaries,
and contextual explanations to help readers understand complex Siddha texts. We also
provide translations and commentaries to make the content accessible to non-Tamil speakers.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<h2>{{ _('Open collaboration') }}</h2>

<p>{% trans %}
We believe that the best way to preserve and improve our knowledge base is through
open collaboration. Our platform allows users to contribute corrections, translations,
and additional content, creating a community-driven resource that grows and improves
over time.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
We welcome contributions from scholars, students, and enthusiasts from around the world,
recognizing that diverse perspectives and expertise enrich our understanding of the
Siddha tradition.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<h2>{{ _('Cultural respect') }}</h2>

<p>{% trans %}
We approach the Siddha tradition with deep respect for its cultural and historical
significance. We work closely with scholars and practitioners to ensure that our
representations are accurate and respectful of the tradition's integrity.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
We also recognize that the Siddha tradition is a living tradition that continues to
evolve and adapt. Our goal is to preserve the historical texts while also supporting
contemporary practice and scholarship.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<h2>{{ _('Technical excellence') }}</h2>

<p>{% trans %}
We believe that the best way to serve our mission is through technical excellence.
Our platform is built with modern web technologies that provide a fast, reliable,
and user-friendly experience.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
We continuously improve our tools and infrastructure to better serve our users and
preserve the texts in our care. We also make our code open source so that others
can learn from and build upon our work.
