Values and Principles
====================

This document describes the values and principles that guide Kalanjiyam's technical
decisions.

Mission
-------

Kalanjiyam's mission is to make the Siddha Knowledge Systems tradition radically accessible.
*Radical access* is Kalanjiyam's core value, and it affects not only the project as
a whole but also our technical decisions.

What does "radical access" mean? It means that we want to remove as many barriers
as possible between people and Siddha Knowledge Systems literature. This includes:

- **Geographic barriers**: Anyone with an internet connection can access our texts
- **Economic barriers**: All of our content is free to use
- **Language barriers**: We provide translations and tools to help non-Tamil speakers
- **Technical barriers**: Our platform works on any device and any browser
- **Knowledge barriers**: We provide tools to help readers understand complex texts

Technical Principles
-------------------

Kalanjiyam's tech stack follows a few basic principles:

**Simplicity over complexity**
    We prefer simple, well-understood technologies over complex ones. This makes
    our code easier to maintain and our platform more reliable.

**Open source everything**
    All of our code and data is open source. This allows others to learn from our
    work, contribute improvements, and build on our platform.

**Performance matters**
    We optimize for performance because slow loading times create barriers to access.
    Our platform should feel fast and responsive on any device.

**Accessibility first**
    We design our platform to be accessible to users with disabilities. This includes
    screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and high contrast modes.

**Mobile-first design**
    Many of our users access our platform on mobile devices, so we design for mobile
    first and desktop second.

**Progressive enhancement**
    Our platform works on any device and any browser, even if JavaScript is disabled.
    We add enhanced features for modern browsers but don't require them.

**Data preservation**
    We treat our data as a precious resource that must be preserved for future
    generations. We use robust backup systems and open file formats.

**Community-driven**
    We build our platform in collaboration with our community of users and
    contributors. We listen to feedback and prioritize features that serve our
    community's needs.
