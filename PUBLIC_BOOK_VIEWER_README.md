# Public Book Viewer

## Overview

The Public Book Viewer is a new feature that allows anyone (without logging in) to view OCR'd and translated books. This provides public access to the digitized content while keeping the proofing interface separate for authenticated users.

- Lists all projects that have OCR'd content
- Shows project metadata (title, author, description)
- Displays progress indicators (OCR and translation completion percentages)
- Responsive grid layout for easy browsing

### 2. Book Details (`/books/<project_slug>/`)
- Shows comprehensive project information
- Displays book metadata (title, author, editor, publisher, year)
- Lists all pages with their status (OCR'd, translated)
- Progress bars showing completion percentages
- Navigation to individual pages

### 3. Page Viewer (`/books/<project_slug>/<page_slug>/`)
- **Dual-panel layout**: Original page image + OCR text
- **Translation toggle**: Switch between original and translated text
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next page buttons
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Arrow keys for navigation, 't' for translation toggle
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Clean interface**: No menus or distractions
